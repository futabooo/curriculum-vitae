It was done by one person from technology selection. Since multiple stable versions of Android Jetpack have been released, official documents and examples from other companies have been increasing, we have adopted a configuration that uses Android Jetpack as the main. In this application, since there are complicated multiple state changes depending on the state of yourself and the other party, we designed it using unidirectional data flow by Flux and implemented it so that the process could be easily followed.

Earlier, I joined as an Android version developer from the middle of where an iOS version application was being developed.
The release date was fixed and it was necessary to take it from 0 to release in about 3 months, but it was unlikely that it was practically possible to assign it as an Android development member because only one was assigned.
So when I talked to an acquainted Android engineer, I was able to find one person on a side job, one person outsourcing to help only for a short period of three months, and managed to complete QA three days before the release date I was able to take it to a state where it could be released.

In this project, I used Jira for task management, but I couldn't give the two people who help me access to Jira because of internal security, so I used GithubProjects. We managed the development by three people by copying the contents of the tasked Jira ticket to GithubIssue after the meeting of internal planning and requirement definition. Priorities are assigned to issues, and if you have free time, you can take issues yourself in order from the top, so that I can save time writing code without doing project management as much as possible I was trying to do it.

```
I had been developing a wide variety of applications, including Android, iOS, Web front-end, and server-side development.
Immediately after participating in the project around 2016, I left the Android development that I had been doing until then and developed a campaign for a limited time to give discounts and privilege options in the application using mainly golang and TypeScript. With the number of paid members registered in the subscription as KGI, the team also performs numerical analysis with funnel awareness such as the number of people who open the billing page, the number of people who open the LP, the number of people who open the application from the email notification and the campaign notification of push notification, etc. And improvements were made.

I was developing an Android version of an application that can create messages and albums like LINE used by couples.
The most memorable thing is that we have implemented an emoticon unique to the application in the message function, this content is also announced at DroidKaigi 2017
